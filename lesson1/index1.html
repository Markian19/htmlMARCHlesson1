    The Simpsons is an American animated sitcom created by Matt Groening for the Fox Broadcasting Company.
    [1][2][3] The series is a satirical depiction of American life,
    epitomized by the Simpson family, which consists of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie.
    The show is set in the fictional town of Springfield and parodies American culture and society,
    television, and the human condition.

    The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a solicitation for a series of animated shorts with producer James L. Brooks.
    He created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after his own family members,
    substituting Bart for his own name;
    he thought Simpson was a funny name in that it sounded similar to "simpleton".
    [4] The shorts became a part of The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19, 1987. After three seasons,
    the sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time show and became Fox's first series to land in the Top 30 ratings in a season (1989–1990).

    Homer Jay Simpson is one of the main characters of the American animated sitcom The Simpsons.
    He is voiced by Dan Castellaneta and first appeared, along with the rest of his family,
    in The Tracey Ullman Show short "Good Night" on April 19, 1987.
    Homer was created and designed by cartoonist Matt Groening while he was waiting in the lobby of producer James L. Brooks's office.
    Groening had been called to pitch a series of shorts based on his comic strip Life in Hell but instead decided to create a new set of characters.
    He named the character after his father, Homer Groening. After appearing for three seasons on The Tracey Ullman Show,
    the Simpson family got their own series on Fox, which debuted December 17, 1989.
    The show was later acquired by Disney in 2019.

    Bart Simpson is a fictional character in the American animated television series The Simpsons and part of the Simpson family.
    He is voiced by Nancy Cartwright and first appeared on television in The Tracey Ullman Show short "Good Night" on April 19, 1987.
    Cartoonist Matt Groening created and designed Bart while waiting in the lobby of James L. Brooks' office.
    Groening had been called to pitch a series of shorts based on his comic strip, Life in Hell,
    but instead decided to create a new set of characters. While the rest of the characters were named after Groening's family members,
    Bart's name is an anagram of the word brat. After appearing on The Tracey Ullman Show for two years,
    the Simpson family received its own series on Fox, which debuted December 17, 1989.
    Bart has appeared in every Simpsons episode except "Four Great Women and a Manicure".
